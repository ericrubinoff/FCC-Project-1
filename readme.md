# FCC Project 1 | George Costanza Tribute Page

## Introduction

I'm thrilled to have finished my first FreeCodeCamp project, creating a Tribute Page to one of my favorite TV characters: George Costanza.

## Challenge

Apart from jumping in head-first into HTML and CSS, the biggest challenge on this project was obsessing over the page layout’s responsiveness. I ended up studying and using CSS Grid, even though the 1-column design definitely didn’t call for it! 

I learned a lot and had a ton of fun struggling with the code until I got the page to function just as I wanted!
